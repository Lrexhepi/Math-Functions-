# Math-Functions-
A collection of fundamental mathematical functions and numerical methods implemented in Python, serving as a learning resource and foundation for applied mathematics and machine learning.

This repository contains implementations of core mathematical functions and algorithms, ranging from basic operations (factorials, prime tests, greatest common divisor) to more advanced topics such as derivatives, integrals, and numerical methods (e.g. bisection, Newtonâ€™s method). The project is intended both as a personal learning journey and as a practical reference, gradually expanding towards applications in linear algebra, numerical analysis, and machine learning.

Key features:

Fundamental arithmetic and number theory functions

Calculus utilities (derivatives, integrals, Taylor series)

Numerical algorithms (root-finding, approximations)

A foundation for further projects in applied mathematics and ML

This repository is a work in progress and will evolve over time.
Feedback, suggestions, or improvements are very welcome!
